However, this rare gem came across my feed and I was intrigued enough to share it here. As a software developer, I feel looking at code from days-gone-by are exteremly important. If not for just the awe that such simple and primitive code was able to navigate Apollo to the Moon and back.",

To me, as a software developer, my biggest question (as I currently type this on an Intel Mac) is how virtualization will be supported on the new architechture. Emulating x86 on ARM will not be the most performant use of the system and running virtual machines on an ARM Mac is still a major sticking point for me on this move by Apple",
